# Chest X-ray Analysis for Disease Detection

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting diseases from chest X-ray images. The project involves data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation. The primary goal is to achieve high accuracy in classifying chest X-ray images into various disease categories.

## Dataset
The datasets used in this project can be downloaded from the link below:

Due to the large size of the datasets, they were not uploaded directly with the project code. Please download the datasets and place them in a folder within the project directory.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/chest-xray-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd chest-xray-analysis
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    Clean the dataset by removing irrelevant or corrupted images. Resize images to a consistent size, check for and handle class imbalances if present, and split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
    ```python
    from PIL import Image
    import os
    import cv2

    # Define dataset directory and image extensions
    dataset_dir = "path/to/your/dataset"
    image_exts = ['jpeg', 'jpg', 'png']

    # Process images and split the dataset
    for image_class in os.listdir(dataset_dir):
        class_dir = os.path.join(dataset_dir, image_class)
        # Add your image processing code here
    ```

2. **Model Training:**
    Customize and compile your model, perform data augmentation, train the model, and fine-tune it.
    ```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow.keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Dropout
    from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
    from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import SGD
    from tensorflow.keras.losses import CategoricalCrossentropy

    # Define and compile your model
    base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
    # Add your model customization code here
    ```

3. **Model Evaluation:**
    Evaluate the model using performance metrics, generate a confusion matrix heatmap, and plot training and validation loss and accuracy graphs.
    ```python
    # Evaluate your model and visualize results
    # Add your evaluation code here
    ```
